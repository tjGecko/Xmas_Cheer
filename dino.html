**Verse 1:**
In the land where the dinos roam, mighty and fierce,
T-Rex in the kitchen, skills about to pierce.
Grilled cheese on the grill, sizzling hot,
Velociraptors gather, craving what T-Rex got.

Spreading butter on the bread, cheddar melting within,
T-Rex with his tiny arms, wearing a chef's grin.
Pterodactyls circling, smelling the feast,
In this Jurassic kitchen, man, even herbivores turned beast.

**Chorus:**
Grilled cheese in the land of scales and claws,
Dinos munching, hear their mighty jaws.
Cheese stretches like lava from a volcano burst,
For that dino-sized hunger, quenching their thirst.

**Verse 2:**
Stegosaurus stepping up, wants a bite of that snack,
Triceratops in line, ain't looking back.
The grill's all fiery, like a meteor in the sky,
But these dinos just cooking, not ready to say goodbye.

Brontosaurus with his long neck, reaching for a taste,
Each bite's an earthquake, no time to waste.
T-Rex flipping sandwiches, a sight to see,
Prehistoric chefs, in their culinary spree.

**Chorus:**
In a world where dinosaurs reign and cheese melts,
Grilled sandwiches on the menu, tightening those belts.
Roars and grunts, in harmony they blend,
In this Jurassic feast, where time bends.
