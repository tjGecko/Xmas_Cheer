            <h2>Verse 1</h2>
            <p>In the land where the dinos roam, mighty and fierce,<br>
            T-Rex in the kitchen, skills about to pierce.<br>
            Grilled cheese on the grill, sizzling hot,<br>
            Velociraptors gather, craving what T-Rex got.</p>

            <p>Spreading butter on the bread, cheddar melting within,<br>
            T-Rex with his tiny arms, wearing a chef's grin.<br>
            Pterodactyls circling, smelling the feast,<br>
            In this Jurassic kitchen, man, even herbivores turned beast.</p>

            <h2>Chorus</h2>
            <p>Grilled cheese in the land of scales and claws,<br>
            Dinos munching, hear their mighty jaws.<br>
            Cheese stretches like lava from a volcano burst,<br>
            For that dino-sized hunger, quenching their thirst.</p>

            <h2>Verse 2</h2>
            <p>Stegosaurus stepping up, wants a bite of that snack,<br>
            Triceratops in line, ain't looking back.<br>
            The grill's all fiery, like a meteor in the sky,<br>
            But these dinos just cooking, not ready to say goodbye.</p>

            <p>Brontosaurus with his long neck, reaching for a taste,<br>
            Each bite's an earthquake, no time to waste.<br>
            T-Rex flipping sandwiches, a sight to see,<br>
            Prehistoric chefs, in their culinary spree.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Chorus</h2>
            <p>In a world where dinosaurs reign and cheese melts,<br>
            Grilled sandwiches on the menu, tightening those belts.<br>
            Roars and grunts, in harmony they blend,<br>
            In this Jurassic feast, where time bends.</p>
