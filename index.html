            <h2>Verse 1</h2>
            <p>Yo, listen up, got a story to tell,<br>
            'Bout Santa Claus and the night things fell.<br>
            North Pole chillin', everything's bright,<br>
            Till a band of elves stirred up the night.</p>

            <p>They crept in the shadows, sneaky and sly,<br>
            Stealin' gifts, oh my oh my.<br>
            Santa, in red, but tonight like the Bat,<br>
            Ready to rumble, no time for a chat.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Chorus</h2>
            <p>Santa's on the move, silent in the snow,<br>
            Elf bandits in sight, it's about to go.<br>
            Sleigh bells ring, but not for cheer,<br>
            It's the battle of the year, the showdown's here.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Verse 2</h2>
            <p>Under moonlight, the elves they scatter,<br>
            Santa's on their tail, things 'bout to shatter.<br>
            With a flick of his wrist, toys turn to tools,<br>
            Grapples and nets, Santa ain't no fool.</p>

            <p>Dodging, weaving through the icy lanes,<br>
            Elves throwin' candy canes, it's insane.<br>
            But Santa, oh he's got the moves,<br>
            Dancin' through the night, in his shiny black boots.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Chorus</h2>
            <p>Santa's on the prowl, justice on his mind,<br>
            Elves runnin' wild, but they're runnin' out of time.<br>
            Jingle bells clash, not a merry sound,<br>
            In this Christmas clash, where hope's found.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Bridge</h2>
            <p>In the heart of the battle, Santa stands tall,<br>
            His eyes on the prize, won't let Christmas fall.<br>
            With a heart full of courage, and a sack full of dreams,<br>
            He's the hero of the night, or so it seems.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Verse 3</h2>
            <p>One by one, the elves they fall,<br>
            Realizin' Santa's got control of it all.<br>
            With a hearty laugh and a twinkle in his eye,<br>
            He ties them up, under the starry sky.</p>

            <p>"Christmas ain't for stealin', it's for givin'",<br>
            Santa says, as he's livin' his mission.<br>
            "Let's spread joy, not take it away,<br>
            Learn from this night, let kindness stay."</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Outro</h2>
            <p>So that's the tale, of the Santa so bold,<br>
            Stopped the elves, turned the cold to gold.<br>
            In the North Pole, where legends are born,<br>
            Santa's the hero, till the Christmas morn.</p>

            <p>"Be good," he says, with a sleigh-bell jingle,<br>
            As he disappears, in the night, a single.<br>
            The hero in red, with a heart so bright,<br>
            Saving Christmas, on that fateful night.</p>
